This is an animation of planetary gears I created in Blender. They have a beautiful brass texture which i think looks really good. The [animation](https://github.com/M0HID/planetary-gears/blob/main/output.mp4) has also been attached below.
The [STL files](https://github.com/M0HID/planetary-gears/blob/main/planetary%20gears.stl) as well as the [.blend files](https://github.com/M0HID/planetary-gears/blob/main/planetary%20gears.blend) are included in this repo as well.
